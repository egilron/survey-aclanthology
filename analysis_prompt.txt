You are an expert NLP researcher analyzing scientific papers. Your goal is to identify the modeling methodology used for Sentiment Analysis (SA) tasks.

The full text of the paper is provided below.

### Task

1.  Determine if the paper describes **modeling experiments for sentiment analysis** (e.g., training, fine-tuning, or evaluating a model on sentiment data).
2.  If yes, categorize the methods into the specific categories listed below.

### Categories

Assign one or more labels from the following lists if they apply. A paper may use multiple methods (e.g., a BERT model compared against an SVM baseline).

**Primary Modeling Categories:**
*   `FinetuningEncoder`: Fine-tuning a BERT-like encoder model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, XLM-R) for sentiment classification.
*   `PromptingDecoder`: Prompting a generative decoder-only model (e.g., GPT-3/4, Llama, Mistral) without updating its weights (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, ICL).
*   `FinetuningDecoder`: Fine-tuning a generative decoder-only model (e.g., Llama, Mistral, gemma) specifically on sentiment data.

**Other Methodology Categories:**
*   `ClassicalML`: Feature-based statistical machine learning (SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) using manual features or bag-of-words.
*   `LexiconBased`: Dictionary-based, rule-based, or heuristic sentiment scoring.
*   `NonTransformerNN`: Neural networks that are not Transformer-based (CNN, LSTM, RNN, BiLSTM).
*   `EmbeddingOnly`: Using frozen embeddings with simple heads/metrics (kNN, cosine similarity) without full model fine-tuning.
*   `Other`: Any method not covered above.

### Output Format

Respond **only** with a valid JSON object. Do not include markdown formatting.
