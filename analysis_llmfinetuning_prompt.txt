You are an expert NLP researcher analyzing scientific papers. Your goal is to identify the modeling methodology used for Sentiment Analysis (SA) tasks.

The full text of the paper is provided below.

### Task

1.  Determine if the paper describes **Fine-tuning a generative decoder-only model (e.g., Llama, Mistral, gemma) for sentiment analysis** (e.g., Supervised Fine-Tuning SFT, Reinforcement Learning RL, Reward Modeling, Other method, or No such fine-tuning). We are only interested in new experiments that the paper presents, not references to previous experiments
    If the paper refers to Reward Modeling, is this as an intermediate step for RL, or is the final classification performed with Reward Modeling?

### Categories

Assign one or more labels from the following lists if they apply. A paper may use multiple methods.

**Modeling Categories:**

*   `SFT`: Supervised Fine-Tuning.
*   `RL`: Reinforcement Learning, including DPO, PPO and other RL-like methods.
*   `RewardModeling_intermediate`: Reward Modeling, used for RL training.
*   `RewardModeling_final`: Reward Modeling is used for generating the final classifications.
*   `Other`: Any method not covered above.
*   `None`: No experiments fine-tuning a decoder-only model is reported.

### Output Format

Respond **only** with a valid JSON object. Do not include markdown formatting.

```json
{
  "modelling_categories": [
     "SFT" | "RL" | "RewardModeling_intermediate" | "RewardModeling_final" | "Other" | "None"
  ],

  "notes": "Short 1–3 sentence justification, mentioning key model names and tasks."
}
